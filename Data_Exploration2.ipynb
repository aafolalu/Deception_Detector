      "interesting book. it is better than &#34;predictably irrational.&#34; indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. but even in this book, ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make seemingly irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />as long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; nevertheless, modern u.s. government is unlike any before. citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable ponzi scheme. a broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. in the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? of course not. government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and increasing expenses. obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. if a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. and now the people are behaving just like their government. this is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />for over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. with a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. and modern u.s. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. there are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. the government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. the government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. why? to insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. obama oligarch, cass sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />for example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, except the supposedly rational u.s. government. homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. in fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did not make imprudent loans. investors in those loans also acted rationally. they understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the u.s. government. first, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. thus, contrary to ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. in fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. for example, the 1960s &#34;great society&#34; and &#34;war on poverty,&#34; created more poverty. the war on gun ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. the welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. despite billions spent on education; math, science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. this is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. education does not make people successful. rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. it is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! there is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />it is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;cargo cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). like modern politicians, the cargo cult confused correlation with causation. citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. many academics and intellectuals, such as ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. that is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. this is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the u.s. has done. the best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. despite ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality.\n"

      "the perfect fitness ab carver pro was the first piece of equipment i purchased when i decided to create a home gym.  along with this, a jump rope, and a waist trimmer belt, i lost 70 pounds over the past 7 months.  if you are just starting out, i'd recommend it be the first piece of equipment you get as well because it allows you to focus on the most important part of the body, the core, which you should focus on first especially when you are just getting started or back into a workout routine.<br />i am not what you would call a bargain shopper (more like an impulse buyer ha) because if i were, i would have realized that you can get this same brand, and same model at walmart for 10 dollars less than what it is selling for on amazon which is currently $39.95.  the ab-carver pro is available on the walmart web site right now for $29.77, so with the added tax (how does amazon get away with not charging tax btw), you'll still save a fist full of dollars.<br /><br />if that is still too steep for you, and i totally understand if it is - still a lot of money to spend on a couple pieces of plastic, the best priced ab wheel i found on here appears to be this one for only $7.00 - [[asin:b00j0f3dr8 wacces ab power wheel ab roller]].  so, that is a good price, a great price actually.  now you are probably asking yourself if you can get an ab wheel for such a ridiculously low price and it will do the job, then why on earth would you spend almost six times that amount and get the ab carver pro!?<br /><br />while i think it may be overpriced, there are two key features on the ab carver pro which make me not regret the purchase.  i only regret not getting it at walmart lol.<br /><br />key feature #1:  the wheel size is very very wide.  this makes a huge difference especially in the beginning.  the wider wheel provides more stability and the increased stability gives room for a greater range of motion which means more muscles are being contracted during the movement.  this translates into getting and seeing results a lot quicker.  when i first started, i highly doubt i could have even completed one full rep on a classic ab wheel but on this i was able to do sets of 6-7 full reps from day one.<br /><br />tip for beginners:  start on a wall, no kidding.  lean into the wall at about 45% angle and start with higher reps of 15 up to 30.  once you can do three full sets of 30 reps take it to the mat (or the knee pads they provide which i don't use personally)!<br /><br />key feature #2:  the contoured handles really help with different angles.  thr great thing about not being in the gym is i'm not stuck in those ab machines which force you to move in one range of motion over and over again hitting the same muscle fibers the same way, every time.  the handles it easy to hit every angle of your ab and core by moving in slightly different directions with each repettiton. with the ab carver, you can literally move in 20 different angles and better still, it doesn't bother my wrists either (like typing this review does for example!).<br /><br />the only other two pieces of equipment i have used and still use in my \"home gym\" are, as i mentioned earlier, a jump rope and a waist trimmer belt.<br /><br />i went through a couple jump ropes before landing on this one;  [[asin:b00ggkpcpg buy jump ropes double unders jump rope]].  my biggest tip here is to make sure you get one that is adjustable in length like this one.  if its too long you're not going to be able to pick up enough speed when you get good at it for it to be effective and if its too short, then your going to have painful welts on your forehead and on the top of your head for a while!<br /><br />i went through more than a couple waist trimmers belts unfortunately until i found the one i own now.  many of these belts are, to be frank; crap.  they are thrown together without much effort and after you sweat in it a few times, it starts to fall apart.  i've been using the one i have now for the past 6 months, so as hard as it is to do, i think this particular belt actually changed my mind about ab trimming belts in general.  i always wear this during my cardio (i.e. running outside) and especially when i use the jump ropes.  i would not suggest wearing one while you are using the ab carver but for cardio and jumping rope this thing will make you sweat in the midsection and burn calories like no tomorrow.<br /><br />[[asin:b00kwiof2y tnt waist trimmer ab belt: stomach fat burner & toner &#x2605; extra wide to cover entire midsection &#x2605; uniquely designed to repel sweat & moisture w/ anti-slip grid technology &#x2605; no slipping or movement of fabric!

      "i really, really want to give the lego falcon a five star rating. it is by far my favorite ship in all the star wars movies, and the lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. also this was the first big star wars lego set i bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys i dreamt of as a kid. i've since purchased six other models including the mighty death star.<br /><br />it really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, i can't. why? because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. i've read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and i don't see it. every time i move it around, i have to be very careful. the side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. at one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and i had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. honestly, i think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn't seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built.<br /><br />okay, now that i said that i can get on to the good stuff.<br /><br />this is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. i spent four afternoons working on it, but that's mostly because i like taking my time putting these things together. i suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon.<br /><br />also, as with the lego death star, which i also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to luke's jedi training ball (even though it`s on the opposite side of the ship). the luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. the tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these lego sets.<br /><br />the inside of the ship is very spacious. you could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. i can't help but think the lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like i said, they already included everything you could think of.<br /><br />also the mini-fig selection is awesome. you get all the main characters in their classic \"new hope\" outfits. though i find the inclusion of darth vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the falcon. i would have liked to see lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in han's absence. they could have even put him in his generals outfit from rotj, but it's seems as if the lego people wanted to stick to the characters from anh.<br /><br />a couple minor complaints before i conclude. as other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. with all the room inside the main body of the ship, i think they could have done more here. same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. it's really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can't be accessed from the interior of the ship. it seems more like an after thought.<br /><br />overall, i hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. it really is an awesome ship, but i just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and i think that should be noted. in spite of a few flaws, it's still very much worth it.\n",

      "i bought this unit for my family because:<br />- it was very attractive and low profile so it could sit in on our kitchen area desk and be very unobtrusive<br />- i wanted good quality photo prints on the occasions that i did those things<br />- i wanted good quality scans<br /><br />on all accounts above it looked and worked great.<br /><br />i also used it wirelessly on a reserved ip address (where it would always boot to that address), and again it was mostly flawless on that account.<br /><br />now for the big downsides:<br />- ink is super expensive for daily printing of our kid's reports, etc and the cartridges are insultingly small in small capacity and large in cost<br />- constantly annoyed at always having to go back to the \"advanced\" dialog menu to change printing from color (expensive) to black and white (can't seem to make black and white default stick - i wonder why!)<br />- can only use epson $$$ cartridges (electronically keyed or something as opposed to my old brother mfc-j630w that you can fill with generic ink once you buy the  refillable cartridges)<br />- i still ended up with problems only using the expensive epson ink ordered directly from them (problems not initially, but later) when my perfectly fine original manufacturer cartridges stopped working (print gaps) even though they were almost new, and then in head cleaning or alignment to try and get a cartridge working again it would often tell me it no longer recognized some of the other cartridges that had previously be reported as near full, and that were previously printing fine, but now suddenly the printer had a problem with them?!<br /><br />in the end i wasted far too much of my time (and anguish) trying to get this thing to print again.<br /><br />my advice : stay away from this model (and probably this brand), because even when you buy, buy, buy into their eco-system, you could still end up with the problems i had, and waste a whole lot of money, your time, and get a lot of frustration trying to fix some unfixable problems.<br /><br />threw the whole unit into the garbage, and went back to using my old brother mfc-j630w, which i got back up and working in less than 30 min.<br /><br />sure the brother doesn't scan as well, doesn't look as nice, and doesn't quite print photos as well, but when i want to print something, it darned well prints, and quickly as opposed to that frustrating slow and often flaky epson (that worked so nicely at the beginning and then became a demon).<br /><br />now i'm happily printing on command, and much, much, more cheaply using my brother.<br /><br />glad to be done with the epson demon.<br /><br />don't think i'm some industry person writing a negative review - i'm a real guy, who is pretty darn technically competent, but i'm just sick of wasting my time and energy on stuff that doesn't work - and i really, really wanted to epson to work on many accounts, but finally just gave up and threw away a frustratingly unusable piece of gear (and a fair amount of money in gear and unusable cartridges).\n",

      "3.75 overall<br /><br />i started watching with no real knowledge of how bbc intended to interpret the legend though i guess i might have been expecting a more historically accurate look and tone (meaning darker and grittier) because that has been the trend with historical movies since gladiator back in 2000, and you can see it now in stuff like spartacus and game of thrones. don't come to this robin hood series expecting that.<br /><br />in this first few episodes, the story is set up with some dark touches with the people starving, and king richard's taxes bleeding everyone dry for the crusades, and people facing penalties like getting their hand cut off for poaching in the sherwood forest. a soldier back from the crusades has a moment of mental anguish from ptsd from his combat experiences. and robin feels guilt when it looks like he might not be able to protect his \"peasants\" from the sheriff. so, the serious stuff starts to get emotionally involving.<br /><br />but then there is far more of the cheesy, unbelievable archery stunts and swashbuckling. everyone looks startlingly 21st century as in clean, scrubbed, well-fed, moussed and gelled, and fitted into the best, tailored costumes from the props department. probably the most unbelievable character is the sheriff of nottingham, a total buffoon who mocks the heroes by making faces and mouthing their words in a snide tone like a five year-old. it is hard to believe that he has the competence to hold a position of authority and be a threat. in one scene, and i am not kidding, he rolls his eyes and says, \"well, yippee.\"<br /><br />so, is this comic satire then? stuff that you're not emotionally involved in at all? well, there are those serious moments i mentioned, so the tone kind of lurches back and forth, at least for me. jonas armstrong is a little bit lightweight as robin hood, but he alternates nicely between twinkly kindness and some quiet moments of stern outrage. but richard armitage in black leather - oh,my god - is total intimidating hotness as the sheriff's main thug guy de gisbourne, and he steals every scene with his glowering eyes and gravelly voice. i may keep watching just for him.<br /><br />overall, i think this robin hood series is enjoyable as a cheeky adventure meant for broad family appeal. if you get impatient with historical stories that are not historically believable, you might want to stay away.<br /><br />edited to add: i have now watched every episode of all three seasons, and have come to a much greater appreciation of the villains who really steal the scenes. the sheriff won me over with his hilarious lines and demeanor. actors keith allen (the sheriff) and richard armitage (the sheriff's henchman guy of gisbourne) are so good they almost seem to be improvising with each other in scenes to add little details of personality. the character of much remains a delight and allan a dale gets a terrific subplot that plays up to his lovable con man personality.<br /><br />i would give seasons 1 and 2 a four-star rating. season 3 gives more intricate costumes to the main characters (nice). it also gives robin a haircut to make him look more macho than mousy (still not possible) and gives gisbourne long hair so he looks like some kind of death-metal god (i liked him better with short hair but, seriously, man, the actor is so beautiful he can rock any look). the reasons i wouldn't give season 3 four stars is the inclusion of two really annoying new characters: the shrill and brassy kate and the pompous and pushy friar tuck who declaims every single one of his lines as if it is a matter of the gravest importance. also the fact that the less-than-compelling robin is the only actor in all the episodes of season 3. gisborne is absent from two and the sheriff is absent from four or five. but i loved the guy who shows up to play prince john for three episodes as a narcissistic creep, and i also appreciated the devious and complex new character of isabella.\n"

      "i read some reviews warning about lead contamination in chinese matcha. i read up on the issue. i found that lead contamination is certainly a big problem with chinese matcha. research done in 2006 by han and his associates at the key laboratory of the ministry of china called &#34;scale and causes of lead contamination in chinese tea&#34; reported that 32% of 1225 samples of chinese tea exceeded the maximum permissible concentration of lead!!! it is a real danger that we all should be aware of. another study has shown that even organic green tea from china contains lead!!!<br /><br />lead has been entering the river yangtze which is one of the main rivers in china and the east china sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in china (huh and chen, 1999). i understand that the contaminated water enters agricultural soil in water irrigation systems which obtain water from the river. from the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. these same leaves are finely powdered to produce chinese matcha. if you drink tea made from chinese matcha, there is a definite risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!!!<br /><br />interestingly, this lead contamination problem does not exist in japan as japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. matcha from japan is much better. tests that have been done on matcha from japan showed that lead in japanese matcha was &#34;not measurable&#34;<br />lead can cause disease in any part of the body. lead can damage the heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), nervous system (including the brain) and bones!!!<br /><br />the way to be sure that lead is not present in chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the chinese matcha. in 2013, consumerlab.com advised people not to eat or consume matcha from china until they are sure about the purity of the matcha!!!<br /><br />it says in the customer questions and answers section that uvernal told a customer called barbara zaretsky that uvernal matcha is made in china. as lead contamination is a big problem in chinese matcha, i believe that the actual laboratory report should be uploaded on to the amazon website by the uvernal so that we can all read the results and get some peace of mind! until then, i am not at all happy to drink this chinese matcha. once i see the laboratory report uploaded on amazon, i'll write more about this product.\n",

      "title says it all... you can do much better as far as sound quality for far less money. they have decent bass, stylish looks, fair build quality, but simply are not the headphones for serious listeners.<br />they performed pretty good on hip-hop, but if you are into anything else, and expect $200 worth of sound, these fall way short. in fact for half the money, you can get a set of sennheisers that out perform these hands down.<br />in my opinion they are simply a name brand fashion accessory and not a performance headphone. guess it boils down to:<br /><br />are you looking for great sounding headphones? - these are not it. they get points for style, and bass performance is solid.<br />mids and upper frequencies are muddy and lack luster. they simply fall flat for most music.<br /><br />are you looking for a fashion accessory and don't really care much for sound over looks and branding? these are your headphones. they do look nice, are fairly comfortable for semi-long wear. they have a solid ( but boomy ) bass response, but really.... at $200, they are just over priced bling.<br /><br />to each their own, i think if people were honest, they couldn't possibly justify the price to performance, had they actually listened to some good headphones. or perhaps they just need to attempt a justification for spending $200 on these, but bottom line is: if you want performance, sound quality, build quality, and maybey not so much the looks and the branding. you can do much much better in a set of grados or sennheisers. if you just want ridiculous bass you can get the klipsch for $50 less and they sound just as good, if not better. i can't tell ya what you like, but i know good sound... and you may have noticed i didn't mention several other over priced branded headphones that i seen others mention. basically for all the same reasons... you can do a lot better for a lot less money. but even if you decided to buy a $200-$300 set of grados or sennheisers, you are gonna get what you paid for, and they will completely destroy the branded price equivalent.<br /><br />that's my opinion : )\n",

      "i was really excited about this filter because it looks nearly identical to the renovo trio but its a few buck cheaper. its cheaper because they don't package it properly and because they are selling my contact information and they are using questionable marketing tactics.  first, the packaging; this filter has an activated carbon filter in it. anyone that knows anything about filtration (air or water) knows that activated carbon must be sealed. the activated carbon is sensitive enough that it will absorb pollutants in the air and wear out. so, as the filter sits in their warehouse the activated carbon is being used up which means it will have questionable efficacy when you really need it. my filter showed up in a cheap box with a sticker on it. these should be sealed at the factory. i placed mine in a vacuum sealed bag when i got it so hopefully there is still some life left. being curious as to what i might expect in terms of shelf life, i checked their website and was surprised to find very little technical documentation. it was mostly marketing hype. they apparently haven't done any lab testing to certify the filter in any way. so, i went to renovo trio's website to see if they had anything and they had overwhelming amounts of data. i found full testing documentation and some helpful information about the activated carbon filter. according to renovo (who has done testing), the activated carbon filter is good for 1,000 liters or 1 year out of its packaging (the renovo is hermetically sealed). so, if this filter sat in some warehouse for 8 months or so before i received it, then i've got 3-4 months to use it before the activated carbon filter is useless. don't get me wrong, as a two stage filter, this is pretty good but i paid for a three stage filter and that is what i was expecting.  second, a week or so after ordering this, i get some telemarketer calling from survivor filter trying to get my email and other details so i can end up on some marketing list. i have never had this happen on amazon and i hope it doesn't become the norm.  so, if you are looking for something that will make you feel like you're prepared (when you really aren't) and you don't care to investigate the validity of a manufacturers claims, buy this! if you would prefer to buy from a company that tests their own products and stands behind their product without selling your name and contact details to a marketing company, then look elsewhere (sawyer, renovo, berkey even lifestraw).\n"

      "i think the reason supplements get such widely mixed reviews is that everyone is looking for a magic pill. they want to make no other changes, take a pill and want the fat to melt away. i have never heard of anything that's ever happened like this.<br /><br />personally i was in what is considered the 'overweight' range for my height and build. everyone said i looked great and scoffed at the idea of being 'overweight', but i kind of felt it. clothes were getting snug and i wasn't comfortable with my own appearance. so i set out to get into the 'healthy' weight range by dropping 20 lbs. or so. i started a regular regimen of exercise and began to watch my caloric intake. after about 8 or 9 weeks i had plateaued after losing about 12-13 lbs. it was frustrating - my weight even slipped up a bit even though i continued my diet and exercise program.<br /><br />i did the research on coffee bean extract. naturally the reviews are all over the place. i figured i didn't have a lot to lose by trying it out, so i got a bottle of this stuff. i'm through the first bottle now and the weight loss is staggering. i immediately blew through the plateau and i've dropped another 10 lbs. in 4 weeks. i've reached my goal but now i'm getting greedy. i'm wondering whether i continue losing to get to the mid-point of the 'healthy' range. i'm very close and there's still a bit of flab here and there that i'd like to see go away. i did still continue with my exercise program at the same time.<br /><br />again, if you're looking for a magic pill move on. in my opinion, and i'm certainly no expert, these supplements only work in combination with changing the behaviors that got you overweight in the first place. this one seems to work extremely well when applied in that fashion.\n",

      "this is an excellent bike pump with gauge! i have tried it on both my mountain, and road bikes. the bike pump is a nice size, but you don't sacrifice efficiency because it shifts air into the tire when you push the handle in and out. i have used it to completely re-inflate one of the 29&#34; tires on my mountain bike. it didn't take any time at all and i wasn't burned up at the end of it. the pump itself is a sturdy, well thought out, and constructed design. the mounting bracket works very well, even if you have bottle cages. i'd highly recommend this pump if you do any kind of cycling.\n",

      "first impression - this tv looks nice. clean front. it is extremely light. the base feels sturdy and big enough to support the tv without risk of falling over. it was simple to put together with 8 screws in the base.<br /><br />just for some background, i'm upgrading from an old  http://fave.co/1bqlewr  in the bedroom. i do have an hdtv in the living room, but it is also a tube tv. there i have a  http://fave.co/1bafxcb  tv that i bought about 7 years ago that was basically the biggest widescreen tube tv made that i know of. back then a tube tv picture was much better and cheaper than flat panel.<br /><br />setup - it has 2 hdmi's and then some regular rca and component hookups. my setup consists of verizon fios cable box and a wd live tv media player (to be replaced by a boxee box within the week, but that's another story). plugged the cable box and the media player into each hdmi port using new amazon basics hdmi cables. the tv on-screen setup was easy enough to figure out without pulling out the instruction manual. everything came up perfectly the first time with just a press of the source button.<br /><br />picture quality - i tested the tv out with several different types of media and sources.<br />1) first with sd cable. a little blocky up close, which may just be the source, but from a normal viewing distance, i the quality was just fine. the kids' cartoons were fine.<br />2) second with hd cable. this picture seemed really nice. didn't see any kind of distortion. seemed nearly as good as the hd tube tv that i have downstairs from an 8 foot viewing distance. i was happy with what i saw.<br />3) third with a normal 720p video file via the media player. picture was really nice in this case also. everything seemed crisp. very happy.<br />4) finally with a fast motion 1080p video file via the media player. this is where i expected the worst, but to my surprise, the fast motion scenes seemed fine also. i only tested a couple of files, so we'll see if other sceneshave a problem, but so far so good.<br /><br />overall i was very happy with the picture quality. the colors on the default setting were pretty terrible, so i tried the presets and settled &#34;dynamic&#34; picture mode and cool color tone in the picture options setting which was pretty much perfect in all instances. looked pretty natural with nice colors.<br /><br />viewing angles - side viewing angles seemed really good. this was one of my pet peeves and most of my reluctance to move to a flat panel tv in the first place. many flat panel tv's look terrible when you aren't watching it straight on. this tv seems to have much better side viewing than many of the competing tv's out there.<br /><br />screen - the screen edges do have a few very faint white areas that i have noticed, but they are barely noticeable and only when the screen is completely black. i don't notice it at all when there is any kind of picture on the screen. i probably only see it because i am looking for it after reading a few comments about backlight bleed. for me, it doesn't seem like anything to worry about. i always buy squaretrade warranties with all my electronics, so if the screen does have a problem, i will be set.<br /><br />sound quality - this is where i had the most trouble. granted, i'm upgrading from a old tv, but out of the box, the samsung sounded very hollow and words were hard to understand. it seemed to be completely missing any low end, not talking about booming bass, just lower frequencies seemed to be missing. i tried every sound preset that they had and all were pretty bad. i finally gave up on the presets and used the included 5 band equalizer which finally did the trick. per request, i posted a picture of the settings in the customer images section of this item. [this section has been updated below: i basically maxed out the low and high frequencies and made a bell curve of the middle frequencies, raising the one that controlled voices until i has happy. this seemed to do the trick just fine and i am now happy with the sound.] granted, if you are expecting a booming surround sound feel, you're shopping for the wrong tv, but for what i think this tv is meant for, it sounds just fine.<br /><br />bells, whistles and other stuff - i haven't toyed with this tv too much yet. there are lots of menu settings to go through. the power button on the bottom of the tv seems pretty cool. it is like a combined button/joystick that pulls up a menu when pressed that you can use the button to move through, or just turn off the tv. i won't use it much since the cable box remote will do most of the work, but it is a nice to have since the actual tv remote will probably sit in a drawer once everything is set up. it does have a usb port that is supposed to play pretty much any type of media format. if this works well, it is a great feature. for me, i plan on continuing to use a dedicated media player, so i probably won't use this much, but for anyone else, it would save you $100 on having to buy a media player if you have a use for it.<br /><br />i've only had this tv for one day, but this is what i think so far for a pro/con list.<br /><br />pros:<br />1) energy star cost of $6-$12 per year to operate. that just sounds crazy, but i'll take it.<br />2) great picture quality, especially for the price.<br />3) very good side viewing angles.<br />4) easy setup and connection to cable box and media player.<br />5) enough picture and sound settings to get the quality you want for your individual preference.<br />6) fast motion scenes seem ok so far.<br /><br />cons:<br />1) sound presets are terrible, but can be adjusted manually.\n",

      "puerto rico\n",
      "puerto rico is the best all around board game i have ever played. the balance i would say is near perfection and of all the games i've played the score was always very close.<br /><br />while this game out of the box takes a little while to understand the nuances of the rules and how to take advantage of the different roles, it's very worthwhile and rewarding. after two plays, my friends were all very into it and anxious to play again.<br /><br />the fifty foot view of the game looks something like this. everyone has a board that has an area for placing plantations and city area for buildings. plantations grow crops, you need certain buildings to produce/store the crops which go in the city area and you eventually want to ship those crops(back to the mainland...whateva) and that's how you ultimately score points. there are variety of different crops you can grow and different types of buildings which give different type of advantages(and are worth a certain # of victory points). each person takes a turn and on their turn chooses a certain role which is how the game functions. each role offers different functions/phases of the game, ie building where everyone gets to build a building, or captain where you get to ship your goods....the player choosing the phase typically gets and additional bonus which is where a lot of the strategy revolves around.<br /><br />some of the things i like about puerto rico, are that you really don't know who's going to win until the game ends and the points are counted up. this keeps everyone interested and playing intently throughout. you also have to be alert on each turn and take advantage of other players moves in order be successful. also, as the other reviewers have stated, luck simply is just not a factor so it's hard for people to be sore losers or point to game flaws that caused them to lose(or someone else to win), instead it's typically a friendly chat about how picking x and y strategy seemed to make the most sense.<br /><br/>the only real downside to this game, is that there really isn't the need for much interaction with other players, or any direct conflict. those coming from a settlers of catan background, the robber phase and the trading are really what makes that...these features are lacking in puerto rico. some say the captain phase can be like the 'conflict', but i disagree. this is a small quibble, and allows you to play with friends and non-friends with no-one getting upset.<br /><br />many say that this game is too deep for non-gamers and that you may want to start off with simpler games to get up to speed. i would actually disagree with that. i've bought a lot of games in the past few months, and i think we could have played puerto rico right off the bat. if you are in the market for new board game, go with this game! take a quick read through the rules, set it up and take a few rounds to get the questions out of the way...than start over and you'll be all set to enjoy a great game.\n",

      "becoming jinn is a beautifully crafted, carefully written tale of 16-year-old azra who has what we all think we want -- the power to grant wishes (and i say this as a completely biased husband of the author but i assure you, every word is true). azra is a smart, funny, caustic, bedeviling, and one-of-a-kind character rarely seen in ya.<br /><br />when the silver bangle is clasped around her wrist that provides this power, it's the final straw in a lifetime fighting the inevitable servitude that this precious gift will truly entail. azra descends from a long line of jinn -- what we refer to as genies -- and a strong incident in her past has turned her away from magic, her jinn heritage, and her zar sisters. finally unable to escape, azra is faced with the dilemma of becoming jinn in a world of humans who she must hide her powers from and yet live among, including the terrific and self-depreciating henry across the street and her lifeguard crush nate. azra must navigate the increasingly complicated world she now inhabits, learning magic, hiding her true self from her friends, and avoiding the afrit, who rule over the jinn and keep the wish-granting jinn and their mothers separated from the males. as azra's first-person tale unfurls, the author is able to demonstrate the frustration, fear, and confusion we all faced as teenagers and journeyed toward adulthood, jockeying for position, affections, and our rightful place, all with azra's wry sense of humor and wit, which punctuates the book throughout. the book builds momentum to an unstoppable pace, beginning with azra's birthday, through her wish-granting, and ultimately to the incidents that bring her full circle in her journey of accepting being jinn. barreling to the end, you will finish demanding that book 2 be released much sooner than april 2016!<br /><br />this is a triumphant debut by an author with a particular talent for creating believable and relatable characters, accurate dialog, and terrific turns of phrase. even if the author wasn't my wife, i would recommend the book to anyone who loves good characters, humor, and a well-executed tale.\n",

      "doctor king's organic japanese matcha is fresh, green, smells great and tastes very good. for anyone that is new to matcha, here are a couple of my favorite matcha recipes.  to make a matcha latte, i sift one teaspoon or two grams of matcha onto 8 oz of hot milk (160 f). i blend the matcha and milk with a hand blender and pour it into a latte glass. sift a little matcha on top. lovely! it has a light bright green color and is delicious! sometimes i make matcha tea with this matcha - it's quite nice. unlike some others brands i've tried, doctor king's matcha is not bitter.  i love smoothies. here is how i make a matcha super smoothie. i use organic vegetables and fruit. i put a handful of organic spinach, one stick of celery. some cucumber, water 4 oz, ice 4 oz, organic japanese matcha 1/2 teaspoon, one kiwi fruit, one pear, one apple and a couple of berries into a blender. blend until smooth. serve in a glass. i say &#34;drink it and feel super!&#34;  i have taken a few pics. i took the pics in a glass in bright lighting. i find that if you look at the matcha in a darker part of the kitchen or in a mug, you don't see the color so well. this product is a very good buy. it is definitely worth trying! :)\n",

      "ab wheel\n",
      "i would certainly recommend this to those looking to lose weight or those looking to tone their core. quite simply it works! i can tell you that this ab wheel is a good price compared to those in store models and its good quality, i have had no issues with it despite tons of use.<br /><br />i've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. as with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. ive never been good at going to the gym so i decided to buy products like this so i can easily workout at my house. so my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. the cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, i usually do some sprints/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. and then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. i work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. the ab wheel is not easy, i know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. after the first few times using it i was sore for the next day! not easy. but if you want results thats what you need.<br /><br />on top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. this healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. for instance upon waking up i drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. in total i stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. i also take a supplement called [[asin:b00ga200wu raspberry ketones ]] which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. that combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. the protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks.\n",

      "my wife saw these water stations being used  at the irvine pet adoption event in 2007, the year we adopted sadie, our 3rd lab rescue. they were set out around the venue to water the guests.  i thought they were a little pricey for a 5 gallon bucket but we were tired of those cheap 5 gallon pet mate plastic jugs that kept breaking. and they are not that cheap once you break 5 or 6 of them. how can you clean the algae out of those things anyway?  but i digress, so if i was at work, my wife could barely lift that 5 gallon jug , invert it and plant it squarely into the base without breaking the jug or spilling water everywhere. so i bought a critter cooler and now i have two, one for inside one for outside, our daughter has a 3.5 gallon, our neighbor has one and we bought another 6.5 gallon and donated it to our local animal shelter. these things are awesome.. i love the little yellow plug so we can drain the bowl and clean the drool and gunk without wasting the water in the tank.. the wheels are high quality, at the home depot they would cost about $7 each. and when we got our daughter her critter cooler, it was missing a valve, so we called the company and the owner, james, called us back and apologized, sent the part priority mail that day and included a bottle of his dog shampoo. so great product and service and my wife was right again.\n",

      "if you're looking for a solution for an outdoor light that basically takes care of itself without the need of a mains electric power source then look no further! once activated and put in place, this light offers an ample amount of light for highlighting those areas which are a little too dark when the sun goes down. i ordered two of these and have one right above my front door (for finding my keys that bit easier when i arrive home), and also one by my gate (so anyone coming in at night has some light to illuminate the path to the door). let's also not forget they are a good security option for informing you of people approaching when put out of arms reach. the light gives off a dim glow throughout the night and switches to a really bright led option when the motion sensor picks up movement. the light then turns back to it's dim setting around 10 seconds after. perfect! the best part about these is their green energy efficiency where they charge throughout the day via the solar panel on the top of them. i'm going to be buying another one of these and i highly recommend them as a cheap option to solve your night time exterior light problems and also to add a dash of security to areas of your property.\n",

      "by bill chambers paramount brings the wolf of wall street home in a bare-bones release that, as anticipated by all but a few chumps, does not contain any deleted scenes or additional footage incorporated into the body of the film. i'm sure hell will freeze over before scorsese restores this or gangs of new york to their original length, though his availing deleted scenes to the public is not unprecedented, as the cape fear dvd and blu-ray demonstrate, so maybe we haven't seen the last of this movie yet. at least the dearth of frills grants the 2.40:1, 1080p transfer of the film itself a generous 42gb berth, and the resulting image is above reproach. practically a star wars prequel in its use of digitally-generated environments, and shot in a mix of super35--sometimes with anamorphic lenses, for the focal distortions--and hd (the arri alexa was reserved for low-light and greenscreen-heavy shots) by argo dp rodrigo prieto, the wolf of wall street nonetheless boasts a cohesive, credible, and cinematic blu-ray presentation with glassy detail and supple dynamic range. grain is extremely subtle, but any noise-reduction was surely done at the intermediate stage rather than after the fact, while an emphatic ruddiness to the skin tones seems to be a scorsese signature of late (see: shutter island). other than size, this is an insignificant downgrade from a dcp screening. the attendant 5.1 dts-hd ma track is a 360¬∞ wall of sound whenever the offices of stratton oakmont erupt in mayhem, although dialogue is always very clear above the fray, including much throwaway adr. song reproduction, critical to a scorsese mix-tape such as this, is excellent, crisp and full.<br /><br />perfect i think they could cut running time down by half hour.<br />the time flew by watching this movie!\n",

      "i have spent the last 12 months trying to find a 28 inch tv for my small home gym. basically i want to be able to watch netflix, amazon instant video and other internet based video offerings on this tv. i began this quest with the predecessor to this tv, the<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b009ibxee6<br /><br />pros:<br />- picture: wow, just an amazing, clear, bright picture. yes i know it's 720p vs 1080p but it doesn't matter to me.... it looks better to me than the samsung which was a 1080p. blacks are black. motion is handled well. the edges are the same as the center near as i can tell. it has different video modes (game, vivid, etc) so you can set it how you want it. note that the factory default is energy saving and they recommend other video modes for the best picture. and speaking of energy savings, the rating says this uses $7 a year, down from $9 last year.<br />- sound: very decent. note i'm not going to say this is surround sound with big bass and captain kirk whizzing by your head. for that you need an external sound system. but the tinny am-radio sound of prior year's models is replaced by very very decent sound. there also different sound modes in the settings area to allow you to customize. sound and picture are very subjective but i'm happy with both and i sure wasn't with my other two vizio's. (the first vizio i added a sound bar, the second vizio i returned for the disastrous samsung model mentioned above).<br />- set up / etc: this tv is significantly lighter than last year's model. and the narrow bezel means that basically it's almost all screen you're looking at... you don't even notice the very small frame around it. even the box this comes in is smaller than the 32&#34; saumsung box ( i still have it so i can return that model ) and the 32&#34; box from the vizio last year. literally i can lift this tv with one hand -- it's that light. it was a pleasure to install. speaking of installation, you turn it on and it immediately guides youthrough a few basic questions (language, how to you get your tv service), it scans some channels and then bam it's up and running. the samsung spent almost an hour scanning channels (this tv is plugged into digital cable directly so it only gets 1 free channel) and then another 20 minutes deleting the scrambled ones. the set up on this is very intuitive and fast.<br />- the remote. this is the same as least year's remote. no back light. no big buttons. but you know what, i like it. my samsung remote had a backlight and looked like a 1990s-era cell phone, 12 inches long and tons of buttons that i never used. yet it was missing a few things this remote has, namely hot key buttons to go straight to netflix, m-go and amazon video. i love those buttons. also this remote is light, easy to hold, and when it falls it is sturdy (yep, already dropped it on a hard floor, no damage). even though the buttons are small, they are logically laid out and i found myself not looking down after a few minutes of using it.<br />- screen mirroring (sort of..): new for 2014 is what vizio is calling &#34;second screen interactivity&#34; which means that supported apps (right now it's just netflix and youtube) allow you to stream videos to the tv similar to apple's airplay functionality. you see a little icon on the screen as you are playing a video in one of these apps and it then plays on your tv. right now this is limited to just those two apps and does not work with videos stored on your ios device or with other apps (e.g. amazon instant video app). i have only tested this on the iphone but vizio's materials say this also works on android devices. i hope more apps take advantage of this feature in the future.<br />- online user manual: normally i don't get excited about an online user manual but this one is clear and easy to navigate. 62 pages long.<br /><br />the cons:<br />- as of this writing, when you go to the amazon instant video app you get this message: &#34;the amazon instant video application is currently unavailable while we are working hard to bring you an updated, feature rich application. for more details, visit amazon.com/videohelp&#34; i'm guessing / hoping this will be fixed soon, but not too cool to ship a tv with an amazon button where amazon doesn't work. i spoke with vizio (great customer service via phone by the way, short hold times and good representative) and they said that amazon is updating the app to comply with fcc requirements around closed captioning. i spoke with amazon and they said they are working on the app but have no date of resolution. so for now, no amazon instant video on this tv. i promise that when they fix this bug i will come back and put an update right here.<br />- dlna sharing. as you might know, dlna is a standard which allows media devices on the same home network to &#34;see&#34; each other and exchange files. so for example, this tv uses dlna to see my movies i have stored on my computer. while vizio gets a plus for the tv immediately seeing the rest of the network and being able to browse files on my computer, it gets a big negative for not being able to play video files that my roku can. it was able to play some .avi files but struggled with .mp4 and .mpg files. in some cases it displayed a message that the &#34;codec is not supported&#34; and in others it just ignored &#34;play&#34; commands. i tried using my playon server to see if the encoding that playon performs would help this tv play the aforementioned files. nope. in this area samsung was stronger and roku is still the best at being able to play anything you throw at it.<br />- no web browser. most of the smart tv's i've used have rudimentary browers. i haven't found on one here so far. i wouldn't use my tv to browse the web but some might be looking for that feature. i will keep looking for it and will update this review if i find one but a google search indicates this is a long-standing yet unfulfilled feature request.<br />- no update feature. i assume this tv downloads updates but i've searched all over the menus and i cannot find an &#34;update now&#34; feature for firmware or apps. this might be a plus if it's all seamlessly automatic in the background.<br /><br />that's it. this is a phenomenal tv at a great price. vizio has come a long way from last year's model in picture quality and especially sound. i recommend you get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b00smbetxs\n",

saumsung box ( i still have it so i can return that model ) and the 32&#34; box from the vizio last year. literally i can lift this tv with one hand -- it's that light. it was a pleasure to install. speaking of installation, you turn it on and it immediately guides youthrough a few basic questions (language, how to you get your tv service), it scans some channels and then bam it's up and running. the samsung spent almost an hour scanning channels (this tv is plugged into digital cable directly so it only gets 1 free channel) and then another 20 minutes deleting the scrambled ones. the set up on this is very intuitive and fast.<br />- the remote. this is the same as least year's remote. no back light. no big buttons. but you know what, i like it. my samsung remote had a backlight and looked like a 1990s-era cell phone, 12 inches long and tons of buttons that i never used. yet it was missing a few things this remote has, namely hot key buttons to go straight to netflix, m-go and amazon video. i love those buttons. also this remote is light, easy to hold, and when it falls it is sturdy (yep, already dropped it on a hard floor, no damage). even though the buttons are small, they are logically laid out and i found myself not looking down after a few minutes of using it.<br />- screen mirroring (sort of..): new for 2014 is what vizio is calling &#34;second screen interactivity&#34; which means that supported apps (right now it's just netflix and youtube) allow you to stream videos to the tv similar to apple's airplay functionality. you see a little icon on the screen as you are playing a video in one of these apps and it then plays on your tv. right now this is limited to just those two apps and does not work with videos stored on your ios device or with other apps (e.g. amazon instant video app). i have only tested this on the iphone but vizio's materials say this also works on android devices. i hope more apps take advantage of this feature in the future.<br />- online user manual: normally i don't get excited about an online user manual but this one is clear and easy to navigate. 62 pages long.<br /><br />the cons:<br />- as of this writing, when you go to the amazon instant video app you get this message: &#34;the amazon instant video application is currently unavailable while we are working hard to bring you an updated, feature rich application. for more details, visit amazon.com/videohelp&#34; i'm guessing / hoping this will be fixed soon, but not too cool to ship a tv with an amazon button where amazon doesn't work. i spoke with vizio (great customer service via phone by the way, short hold times and good representative) and they said that amazon is updating the app to comply with fcc requirements around closed captioning. i spoke with amazon and they said they are working on the app but have no date of resolution. so for now, no amazon instant video on this tv. i promise that when they fix this bug i will come back and put an update right here.<br />- dlna sharing. as you might know, dlna is a standard which allows media devices on the same home network to &#34;see&#34; each other and exchange files. so for example, this tv uses dlna to see my movies i have stored on my computer. while vizio gets a plus for the tv immediately seeing the rest of the network and being able to browse files on my computer, it gets a big negative for not being able to play video files that my roku can. it was able to play some .avi files but struggled with .mp4 and .mpg files. in some cases it displayed a message that the &#34;codec is not supported&#34; and in others it just ignored &#34;play&#34; commands. i tried using my playon server to see if the encoding that playon performs would help this tv play the aforementioned files. nope. in this area samsung was stronger and roku is still the best at being able to play anything you throw at it.<br />- no web browser. most of the smart tv's i've used have rudimentary browers. i haven't found on one here so far. i wouldn't use my tv to browse the web but some might be looking for that feature. i will keep looking for it and will update this review if i find one but a google search indicates this is a long-standing yet unfulfilled feature request.<br />- no update feature. i assume this tv downloads updates but i've searched all over the menus and i cannot find an &#34;update now&#34; feature for firmware or apps. this might be a plus if it's all seamlessly automatic in the background.<br /><br />that's it. this is a phenomenal tv at a great price. vizio has come a long way from last year's model in picture quality and especially sound. i recommend you get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b00smbetxs\n",

      "i have used various types of wash mitts over these years, but all of them felt a bit slippery inside after some time and became harder to hold with my hands. after reading number of reviews on amazon, i decided to purchase wash mitts from crusar due to their good elastic wrists and pretty good size. i was really impressed with their shipping timings and nice packaging. these wash mitts are perfectly fit for my hands. these microfiber mitten has longer fibre fingers and therefore has more ability to absorb waters.  these mitts are also great for other purposes like dusting of delicate objects, electronics and even soaking wet dogs after a bath. overall, the products are very good so far and worth caring for. i would surely like to recommend for all washing and drying purpose.\n",

      "to start with, my copy of this dvd plays perfectly so the reviewer who has complained his copy doesn't appears to have a faulty disc and should merely send it back for a replacement.<br /><br />the documentary is a very interesting trawl through the band's history from their first album to the point in the early 1980s when they hit the very top of the rock music ladder and were without doubt the biggest band on the planet. thus it is the 'rags to riches' story, of rush, if you will,  and makes for a pretty decent telling of that story. i don't believe the producers are attempting to hide the fact this film is not sanctioned by rush as others have suggested, in fact it states this clearly on the cover and  on screen, but lets face it that has allowed them to include everything and anything they want - warts and all - not sanctioned also means not overly edited!. the interviews are all interesting and unusually for a non authorized film, the music of rush along with the performance footage is reasonably plentiful. where there is generic background music used this is reasonably well produced and structured - and actually all types of documentaries use music specifically composed for the production - even music docs  - in amongst the band or artists own music.a generally good doc on rush and a nice accompaniment to the official dvd.\n",

      "i picked the casio ae1000w as a cheap beater watch for traveling and work and it's performed admirably given the price i paid. i've owned it for a year. it is a fairly large watch with a resin band so it may feel a little odd if you have slender wrists, but it is very lightweight. the current watch face does have a few small scratches over the course of my time using it but they're not particularly bad and everything else has held up well. it's done fine given that this is essentially my beater watch.<br /><br />the world time features are nice and easy to use. you can select 5 time zones as your most frequent time zones for the primary timekeeping mode and then easily change the main time zone out as needed. it's particularly nice because you can easily turn dst on or off for any one time zone. it's also been holding time quite well.<br /><br />the 5 alarms are useful - they can be set to be single use or recurring which makes them nice for simple reminders or as a backup wake-up alarm (although it's a little quiet if you're a heavy sleeper). the digital timer is a very useful feature and the stopwatch works as advertised.<br /><br />the analog face is a little pointless in that it's extremely difficult to read compared to a true analog watch. the center dot is extremely large compared to the size of the face's hand segments. it's more of a novelty, but it does allow you to see the time in your primary time zone in all modes (including the stopwatch or timer mode) so it's useful in that respect. the light is an orange/amber colored led that illuminates the time from the side of the face rather than evenly throughout the entire face of the watch. it works fine, regardless.<br /><br />need a cheap watch with plenty of features? it's not terribly slim, but it's got that great intersection of price and plenty of features that it's hard not to recommend.\n",

      "whether evaluating presentation, performance, ease of operation, versatility, this  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b00smbggv6  is without a doubt one of the best you can get these days at this price level. it's a large sound bar plus subwoofer and satellite speakers set that support just about any type of 'wired' connection including hdmi  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b00nh126q0  out with arc and can also pair and play off bluetooth supporting devices such as phones or tablets.<br /><br />just to get it out of the way, i am going to start with the negatives, few as they are and will follow with a detailed description of what you are getting. so, here are the negatives:<br /><br />- partially wired. the satellite speakers are in fact wired to the subwoofer, probably a small price to pay for true surround.<br />- 5.1 surround, not 7.1 or 7.2. yes, it's a sound bar, not a full surround speakers set.<br />- can't play off usb thumb drives or sd cards directly. you will need some bluetooth device for that.<br /><br />and that's it, all the negatives i can think of so let me discuss the system overall.<br /><br />presentation and packaging<br /><br />as i noted above, this is a massive set and vizio did an excellent job to get everything in a neatly organized box with all components clearly labeled and easy to locate. this is what's in the box:<br /><br />‚àô the 54&#34; bar<br />‚àô subwoofer<br />‚àô 2 satellite speakers<br />‚àô remote control and batteries<br />‚àô cables: optical, stereo rca 3.5 mm, coax, hdmi, 2 satellite speaker, 2 power cables  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b00nh126q0<br />‚àô mounting hardware: 2 sound bar wall mount brackets, 2 sound bar wall mount lugs, 2 satellite speaker wall mount brackets, 2 satellite speaker wall mount lugs<br />‚àô wall mount template<br />‚àô 4 velcro cable ties<br />‚àô quick start guide<br /><br />all of the above are quality items and i experienced near zero frustration getting them out of the box. even better, just in case you may wish to return your purchase, there is a nice diagram on the box that shows exactly where everything is so, for as long as you don't destroy the styrofoam it should be easy to get everything back in.<br /><br />setup<br /><br />getting everything to work was quick and easy.<br /><br />the manual is very well written and it covers and illustrates the speakers layout, mounting and how everything is connected. it explains clearly how to use the hdmi's arc feature with your tv (make sure that the tv supports it if you are going to buy a new one) and how to wire several devices to the bar, taking advantage of its many ports.<br /><br />by the way, you get: rca analog audio in, optical, 3.5mm analog audio in, digital coax audio in, hdmi out (arc), hdmi in and usb. and, of course you can pair wirelessly via bluetooth. the bar supports aptx, allowing real-time streaming of high quality stereo audio over bluetooth.<br /><br />operation<br /><br />the set comes with a great, simple and effective remote control. it really comes down to selecting the proper input and then let it roar, so to speak. the manual explains how you can integrate the system into another 'universal' remote. i haven't tried that yet but it appears to be very much the standard remote 'learning' process.<br /><br />the subwoofer has a wireless link to the main bar which was properly set in my case but, just in case, there is a pair button also. all wires are properly labelled and, as i noted already, the manual explains how you can have several devices connected. all was quickly done for my experimental setup involving a tv and a gaming console.<br /><br />when paired with a bluetooth device, your phone or tablet or laptop have complete control over what is playing on the bar.<br /><br />performance<br /><br />getting to the final question of 'how does it sound', the brief answer is 'it sounds grrreat'. thanks to the satellite speakers, this is true 5.1 surround, not a simulationand it's done through some good quality hardware.<br /><br />talking specs, this is what you get:<br /><br />‚àô sound pressure level (system): 104 db<br />‚àô frequency response (system): 45 hz - 20 khz<br />‚àô 2 3&#34; full range transducers (bar, one left and one right)<br />‚àô 2 3x6&#34; bass radiators<br />‚àô 3&#34; full range transducer (bar, center)<br />‚àô 2 3&#34; full range transducers (one per each satellite)<br /><br />support and warranty<br /><br />vizio promises lifetime support for the product to cover setup, connecting and technical problems. they also have a one-year limited warranty.<br /><br />rating<br /><br />i have no choice but award vizio's bar 5 stars because i love it. it's as close to ideal for anyone looking for a 'serious' bar to work with a large tv that delivers great surround and plays off mobile devices. get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b00smbggv6\n",

      "congratulations, you just saved $100 from the cheaper version http://fave.co/1c3qcua  i purchased this tv from an authorized dealer in seattle because i didn't want to wait. price was the same, and i would still have to pay tax in seattle on amazon. i have owned the 55&#34; version of the tv for a month and a half.  on research i was put off by the xbr900b having better dimming and contrast control but having the speakers on the side that i find to be quite gawdy. i wish there was an intermediate between the it and the xbr850b that had the dimming but not the speakers, but i digress. i checked this out in the store vs the samsung 8550 and 7150. both the 8550 and xbr850b blow away the 7150 with the same content moved to each one. i personally prefer the sony to the samsung. the samsung is over saturated and isn't as crisp. the sony xbr850b just looks better to me. i also tried out the sony xbr800b and the difference in color is very noticeable.  i started using the stand, but eventually ordered one of these to mount it. it looks great mounted! http://fave.co/1c3qdpf  the menu is easy to navigate. the settings are easy. the out of the box calibration is nearly perfect. the smart app functions work well. the 4k upscaling is incredible. it makes 1080p look like broadcast junk.  the build quality on this is excellent. the camera folds back so it is invisible from the front. i'm sure you have been reading the same things that i did on the interwebs. &#34;panel lottery,&#34; &#34;clouding,&#34; &#34;flashlighting,&#34; \"soap opera effect\", etc. there is a tiny spot on the righthand side that i can see being a tad bit brighter. when i first noticed it, i really noticed it. the next day i could hardly see it, and it doesn't distract me at all. a couple adjustments to backlighting and brightness and i can't see it anymore except on boot-up. i don't notice any clouding except maybe on the boot screen, maybe. i do not see it on the netflix screen or anything like that. you can change settings and see soap opera effect, but you can also change those settings back and not see it. really, that is more of a problem with processor sharping because all lcd/led tvs are blurry in movement. tvs of this caliber are fast enough to sharpen and make the motion seem natural.  where the tire meets the road, as the old saying goes, is where this tv shines. everything is beautiful on it. streamed netflix is beautiful, itunes purchases streamed by the apple tv are beautiful, blu-rays in my ps4 are beautiful, and games on my ps4 are beautiful.  i shopped around. i educated myself. i kicked the tires on many tvs. i was very informed. you really have to spend a lot more coin to get better performance than what this tv delivers and the percentage better is extremely minimal for the large jump in price. at the sale price of $1750 before tax, this is really the best performance for coin spent. black are deep, colors are vibrant, resolution is incredible, upscaling works flawlessly and makes quite a huge difference, and it is mesmerizing. i am confident that i will enjoy this tv for a long time. i highly recommend this tv. i apologize if this review doesn't have discussions on black room viewing (i turn the brightness down 4 at night and it looks great), tv lingo, what serial number panel is installed (i have better things to do with my life), or every spec of the tv (that is available online easily.) i really enjoy my purchase and think you will too, especially at this price at this time. also, don't worry about the 4k content, the upscaling is incredible. it will take the industry years to adapt to this since it just adapted to 1080p. this tv looks better than 1080p tv while viewing 1080p content.  in summary, i now recommend all my friends check out the: http://fave.co/1bkkvpy  i really hope you found this review helpful. jessicaag=i60-25\n",

      "i just purchased this tv from costco last night. if anything of substance changes, i'll take the time to post an update.  i had this sharp tv for about a month now, and so far i have been pretty pleased with my purchase. this is my second sharp tv. the reason i also bought this 40&#34; is because i've been really pleased with this sharp here: http://fave.co/1cwfhfn  things worthy of note: - it is much more convenient to be able to watch digital media directly on the tv than it is to have a roku, chromecast or wii. they are fine devices and you should probably check them out regardless for their extra features, especially the chromecast if you're getting a different tv. roku   http://fave.co/1cgu0wu chromecast    http://fave.co/1cwzerc apple tv http://fave.co/1cgyiof  - my remote came with the three programmed buttons of amazon instant, netflix and iheartradio. obviously i would prefer them to be netflix, hulu plus and hbogo, but i suppose that you can't please everyone. it would have been nice if you can reprogram them to your desired channels. - big con: there is a buzzing noise that comes from our tv when it's on. it's quiet enough that you don't hear it when you're watching anything with sound, but when there isn't sound, it can be heard even from the other room. this might be a defect with my specific tv. i will update this review if the noise stops or changes. - the picture and sound are great for my purposes. - our router/modem happens to be right next to our tv stand, so i do have a wired connection set up. i notice it being slightly faster in load times than wireless, of course, but it doesn't make a huge difference. - i think the tv is worth the money, but i think that i'll return mine to costco if the buzzing doesn't go away. - i also posted this review on costco's website, fyi.  it was not a big surprise to me that this tv also works like it should! in one word the tv works great. the picture quality is lovely, the sound is decent (and can be upgrade with a sound bar), and i don't have any daily problems or complaints about it. the remote is a little cheap as others have mentioned, but it works just fine for me, and has a simple layout that is easy to use. this is a smart tv so it has a few preloaded apps and ability to connect to the internet. i had difficulty actually launching and using any of the apps other than the netflix app, but i have a console to run most of my apps so i found these features pretty good.  in the end i recommend you get yourself this tv. it's worth it. http://fave.co/1cwfvw2\n",

      "mortal kombat x - xbox one from a gameplay perspective, mortal kombat x easily eclipses everything that's come before it. netherrealm has taken all that they learned in the making of 2011's mortal kombat and injustice: gods among us to create an mk experience to appeal to both casual and hardcore fans.  the &#34;kollector's&#34; edition gets good marks too and in addition to the game you also get a scorpion figurine by coarse, certificate of authenticity, gold scorpion skin and kombat pack downloadable content. it might be worth checking out here:  http://fave.co/1c3tmz7  mortal kombat x does play well. moving back to 2d combat was the best move for mortal kombat after some clunky efforts at 3d play from a couple of generations ago, as it has allowed the team to focus on linear combos and giving the attacks a brutal characterisation behind them.  balancing is good, though it won't take long for each player to find their favorites. i personally became accustomed to cassie quickly. partly because i didn't want to be on the receiving end of the ball busting move, but also because she's quick and her attacks have good flow to them. i found the bigger, heavier characters to be almost unmanageable in how clunky their attacks flowed together, but of course the first time i jumped online i ran into someone who showed me what those characters were capable of (and left me with a shredded cassie to show for the lesson).  it remains a very accessible fighting game, with relatively small move lists for each character, though at the start of each battle it's possible to select from three different \"stances‚äù, which effectively means that each character is three different play styles in one.  the complete list of characters in the game, some of which are classics include: baraka, bo' rai cho, cassie cage, d'vorah, daegon, ermac, erron black, ferra & torr, fox, frost, fujin, goro, jackson briggs, jacqui briggs, jason voorhees, johnny cage, kabal, kano, kenshi, kitana, kotal k'etz, kotal kahn, kuai liang, kung jin, kung lao, li mei, liu kang, mileena, nightwolf, predator, quan chi, raiden, rain, reptile, sareena, scorpion, shang tsung, shinnok, shujinko, sindel, smoke, sonya blade, kurtis stryker, suchin, takeda takahashi, tanya, taven, tremor  in short i'd recommend picking yourself up a copy of:  http://fave.co/1c3tyhj\n",

      "i've had the    http://fave.co/1bquup5   for almost a month now and have used it everyday extensively. i give it a solid 5 stars because it admirably performs way above it's price range. a 28 inch led hdtv at the $200 price level is an amazing accomplishment all on its own. -- the tv has its quirks, some which would cause it to lose a star or two if it was twice the price or more as other brands are for the same thing. and so complaints about the tv in other reviews here are comparable to reviewing a $10k new car and complaining that the power window motor isn't as smooth or powerful as in their $70k mercedes, and that the engine isn't as smooth and powerful as a car several times its price - or the stereo isn't as fancy, etc. --- this tv is a $200 28 inch led hdtv - so keep that in context and you'll be amazed by it. the only other tv i would possibly consider at this price point would be the    http://fave.co/1bqvjb5  the picture is absolutely perfect - high-def sharp - the colors are all perfect with no video distortions anywhere across the entire screen. the complaints about this tvs audio is really strange, because the audio is quite good - much better than i would expect for such a low priced tv. -- i suppose if you put this tv in a large living room - viewing it from 14 to 16 feet away, then the audio may not be perfect for that application.  the overall aesthetics of the tv are also quite impressive - very sleek with a thin black border frame, sitting on a wide stable stand that is one of the best designs for a tv stand i've ever seen - placing the tv low to surface it is sitting on - making it very secure on its feet - instead of the way its done on almost all other tvs; stupidly stuck up in the air on some spindly center pole.  the inputs on this tv are indeed limited. it doesn't have three or four of every input imaginable. instead, it has two hdmi inputs, one component input, one vga (rgb-pc) input for your computer, and a 75 ohm cable input. as far as which hdmi cables to use i recommend amazon's very own    http://fave.co/1bquupe  that's it, but if you need more than that, then you should be prepared and willing to spend a lot more than $200. --- i use my e280-b1 for both a tv and a computer monitor and i am very impressed with its performance as a computer monitor. a 28 inch dedicated computer monitor costs twice as much as this tv, yet this tv outperforms all the dedicated hi-def digital computer monitors i've had - very impressive indeed.  there are some quirks. the earphone audio output comes from the factory at a unusably low audio level, which is unaffected by the volume control. to make the earphone jack useful, you need to go into the menu - choose &#34;audio&#34; and then &#34;analog audio out&#34; and change that setting from &#34;fixed&#34; to &#34;variable&#34; -- back out of the menu and your earphone jack in now useful and controlled by the tvs volume control. - and the remote control is much smaller than other remotes, so it takes some getting used to before it feels comfortable to use. the rc being small takes away space that could have been used to include the four main input selections as dedicated buttons - instead of having to go into &#34;input&#34; each time and scroll to choose the one you want. other than these quirks, the tv is most definitely as good as it gets - and much more - for a $200 tv.  it deserves 4.9 stars, but since there is no such rating, rounding to the nearest whole number gives it 5 stars. i would highly recommend this tv to anyone needing a hi-def tv for a small room or their office to be used as a tv and monitor - because you get way more than what you paid for.....  in the end i recommend the    http://fave.co/1bquup5\n",

      "if you're anything like me you see that this tv is labeled as led; then you look at the picture and see a lot of fat for the usual samsung led depth. make no mistake this is an led tv. i got this for my bedroom to replace my 23 inch samsung syncmaster. it is great for the price and i'd recommend it. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b00c18yrsa  i use this tv mostly for 1080 mp4 movies and blurays (i download what i want to watch instead of waiting for it on cable), and my xbox and ps3.  long story short, comcast had me thinking i purchased my first dud from samsung. seriously, the colors look washed out and none of the channels really had that crisp clear picture i was hoping for. if you plan to use this solely for comcast, i can't really recommend it. in fact, i've always found blu ray quality to be so much better than cable that i've stopped using cable for anything but football and cartoons. movies must be in my ps3's blu ray player or my own 1080p files.  i learned 2 things about the tv right off the bat. if you have comcast, you cannot fully customize the tv's picture. an essential feature called hdmi black levels actually looks much better when its set to low. i have 2 different comcast hd boxes and since neither of them broadcast at 1080, this feature is locked out.  i had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b000wyvbr0  the second thing i learned about is what the depth is for. samsung didn't advertise this (or maybe its just my tv), but i have absolutely no backlight bleed. when black ops goes to the loading screen on my xbox, it gets so dark that i think the tv is off! the only indication that it is on is the black ops logo in the corner spinning. there isn't even the slightest inkling of white anywhere! i'm not exaggerating. the obvious second reason why this tv is fat for an led is that samsung made an effort to improve the sound. when i turn on the hd surround coupled with the movie option, there is much more bass than i thought it would be. the explosions in my games and the soundtracks in movies sound vastly better than i thought they would. granted, i am not the type to go out and spend 600 on some bose speakers, but the sound is not a con for me this time around.  now on to the picture  as i said, i was not exactly thrilled with the picture right off the bat. it looked like my old 23 inch syncmaster, just a lot bigger. let me tell you, this is not one of those tv's that look great right out of the box. you have to toy around with the settings a bit to get the optimal picture. i wanted sharpness coupled with colors that pop like crazy.....and i got it. dynamic is the brightest setting, but i coupled this with the hdmi black levels set to low (option not available for comcast cable box) and voila, moving photographs! i'm not a pro but this is my setup:  mode: dynamic backlight: 18 contrast: 85 brightness: 50 sharpness: 80 color: 70 tint: g/r 50/50 standard color tone with screen fit in the additional options, with hdmi black level set to low.  my games and blurays look amazing. the picture is easily better than my mom's 46 inch samsung up front. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b0071nwyp8  remember that some of the good options are cut off from comcast and the use of component cables. in games, i do have to up the brightness or gamma a little, but it ends up looking brilliant. i am going through my entire library of games and they feel like entirely new experiences! there is a 32 inch 720p option as well, but i just was not comfortable with 720p max. the new game consoles are gojng to have native 1080 so that's what i wanted. btw did i mention i'm a big gamer?  the cons  with a comcast cable box i could see no difference between hdmi and component. i kept switching back and fourth, but since the max output is 1080i, there were no differences in picture.  well i saw this tv up on amazon before it was on samsung's website. yeah, wow. sometimes i wanted to see the tvs specs from samsung directly before i made my buy. make no mistake this is not a 120 hz tv although it is labeled as one. i have no idea what clearmotion 120 is, but it makes my tv much darker. the feature is entirely useless and does nothing to the picture or add the &#34;soap opera&#34; effect like i had hoped (it looks great for games).  verdict  with a lot of tweaking, i got the picture to look beautiful. i will use my comcast box sparingly, but i might move to fios if the support full 1080. watching movies on my ps3 and playing games on my xbox stopped me from returning the tv. i will not be surprised if this set gets bad reviews from comcast users (even though its not samsung's fault). i'm a &#34;videophile&#34; and this passed my personal test with vibrant colors.  in the end get yourself one of these http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/b00s5mbb1c\n",

      "if i don't wear it even for a single day, the watch stops running. it appeared like the automatic energy storage worked better when i first received it, but in just a few short months, the mechanism has deteriorated where i have to wear it or \"shake\" the watch everyday to prevent it from stopping. the watch itself is very nice to look at and i've received compliments from friends on the unusual color of the watch.\n",
